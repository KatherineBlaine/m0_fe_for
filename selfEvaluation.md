# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement?

I feel pretty confident! I struggled with this exercise a bit more, but it was helpful that the instructions didn't give you all of the commands becaue it pushed me to me practice googling things, and the material sticks for me a lot more when I am able to find out what different commands do by trying them out and working through the errors.

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

I am proud to say all of my struggle was productive! I got confused when the assignment had us put if statements within for statements, but I looked back on my previous if statement assignments which helped me figure it out. It feels really rewarding to get the output you are looking for when you have to figure things out for yourself. 

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

I think the index positions still have me a bit confused, and the concept of loops is really complicated to me. I think getting more comfortable with the syntax by going over these exercises again will be helpful for me, and I'm hoping to find some time tomorrow to complete the exercises again.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

I am wondering if index positions are what we are referring to in the for statement syntax. Like when we say var i = 0, are we referring to the index position within an array?

I'm confused because as the exercise discussed, you don't need an array to create a for statement, so in these situations, how would we be referring to index positions ofan array that doesn't exist?

This is something I will definitely bring up next time we are in our groups, and hopefully look into more before then!
